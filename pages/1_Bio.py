st.write("My name is Toren and I am a computer science major at MSU Denver. 
I take interest in having a greater understanding of the world around me and 
being able to navigate the complexities that I see around me every day. I 
utilize python along with various libraries such as Pandas, MatPlotLib, and 
Plotly to name a few in order to analyze data files into easily understandable 
and accessible interpretations of their contents. When visualizing data, I 
believe that it is always best to have the most accurate and well conceptualized 
data and interpretations possible so that the most truthful possible understandings 
can be drawn from a strong analysis of information.")
